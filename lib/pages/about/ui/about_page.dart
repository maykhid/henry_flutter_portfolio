A long time ago I started my career as a mechanical engineer, but quickly realized that developing software is my true passion. My degree in mechanical engineering turned out to be a tremendous help equipping me with strong problem-solving abilities, analytical thinking, and attention to detail.

I have around 4 years experience developing mobile apps. I co-founded two companies called Bread&Pepper and Gibbon. The last one got acquired by Degreed, and for several years I have enjoyed leading and growing the product design team of this edtech unicorn.

I love the simple things of life. I am a cinephile, music and anime lover, on my free days, if you don't spot me with a friend I am most likely indulging in one of those. 

If you think I can help you with any project or coaching, don't hesitate to get in touch.''',
